# Operating System Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project is an analysis of operating systems and their role in computer science. The focus is on understanding key processes such as job scheduling, process management, memory management, and the differences between traditional and distributed operating systems. The project includes implementations of various scheduling algorithms, solutions to synchronization problems like the producer-consumer problem, and an exploration of virtual memory and dynamic linking/loading in operating systems.

## Research Objectives
1. Investigate job scheduling algorithms, including Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, and Shortest Job First (SJF), both preemptive and non-preemptive.
2. Implement a solution to the producer-consumer problem using C under Linux, with synchronization mechanisms for managing a shared buffer.
3. Explore virtual memory and its role in memory management, including an evaluation of paging systems.
4. Analyze and compare traditional centralized operating systems with distributed operating systems, highlighting concurrency and performance optimization techniques.
5. Discuss the importance of dynamic linking and dynamic loading in improving program efficiency and flexibility.

## System Features
- **Job Scheduling Algorithms**: Implementation of Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, and SJF (Preemptive and Non-Preemptive) algorithms. Outputs include turnaround time, waiting time, and average turnaround/waiting times.
- **Producer-Consumer Problem**: A solution using C, demonstrating the synchronization between multiple producers and consumers with a shared buffer of limited size.
- **Memory Management**: Critical evaluation of virtual memory and paging, with practical examples.
- **Distributed vs. Centralized OS**: An in-depth comparison of operating system types, including examples of real-world applications using distributed systems.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C (for Producer-Consumer problem and other system-level implementations)
- **Operating Systems**: Linux, with some tasks involving Unix, Windows, and MacOS for comparisons.
- **Tools**: Standard C libraries for system-level programming, Linux shell for process management.

## Conclusion
The Operating System Analysis Project provides a comprehensive understanding of essential operating system concepts such as job scheduling, process management, memory management, and distributed systems. Through practical implementations and comparisons, the project demonstrates the importance of these concepts in modern operating systems and their impact on overall system performance and efficiency.
